# language-translator-application

By making use of IBM Cloud SDK which was integrated in a Spring Boot project for the back-end side I
created a mini-Google Translate service. The application is able to translate a text from a language to
another one and also to create a .wav file corresponding to the selected text (the original or the translated
one) in order to listen to the pronunciation. The GUI is based on a web page implemented on Angular
framework and is connected to the back-end project which runs separately by sending HTTP requests.
